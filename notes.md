# User Aesthetic & Workflow Preferences

Based on our collaborations, here are key artistic, stylistic, and workflow preferences that have been identified.

## Core Concepts & Themes
- **Creation Process:** The user is interested in visualizing a creative process, especially the transformation from a 2D representation to a 3D object.
- **Implied Creator:** Prefers to focus on the artwork itself, without showing the artist's hands or the artist directly. The creation appears to happen autonomously.

## Visual & Animation Style
- **Primary Aesthetic:** Favors an `ink-and-watercolor` hand-drawn style.
- **Atmosphere:** Prefers a `warm, quiet, and gentle` mood for the final scene.
- **Compositional Effect:** Consistently uses `tilt-shift` and `shallow depth of field` to create a strong `miniature diorama` feel.
- **Animation Preference:** Enjoys dynamic, forceful, and playful animations with a sense of physical weight and impact (e.g., "flip and slam"). Prefers animations that are grounded with a clear physical logic (e.g., "pivoting on its bottom edge," "paper remains stationary").

## Cinematography & Composition
- **Camera Angle:** Often starts with a `top-down shot` and transitions to an `eye-level medium shot`.
- **Camera Movement:** Prefers camera movement to be integrated with the action, like a `slow orbit` that circles the subject as it transforms.
- **Lighting:** Prefers `soft, directional window light` that creates long, gentle shadows.

## Workflow & Prompting Preferences
- **Final Prompt Format:** Strong preference for a **concise, fused paragraph** over a structured, multi-part prompt. The final prompt should read like a director's shot description, blending action and cinematography.
- **Iterative Refinement:** The user is very hands-on, providing specific, iterative feedback to refine animation details.
- **Preference for Concrete Language:** Rejects subjective, abstract adjectives (e.g., `magically`, `dramatically`) in favor of direct verbs and physical descriptions (e.g., `slams down with a sense of weight`).
- **Use of Analogy:** Finds it effective to use pop culture analogies (e.g., `Game of Thrones opening sequence`) to anchor an AI's understanding of an animation *mechanism*, but is careful to explicitly separate this from the final *visual style*.
- **Ineffective Elements:** Has concluded that `Negative Prompts` are ineffective for their use case and should be omitted.

## Key Satisfactory Outcome
_This section documents a successful result from our collaborative refinement process._

- **Challenge:** To create a video of a 2D illustration transforming into a 3D object in a dynamic, physically believable, and visually interesting way.
- **Successful Prompt (Final Fused Version):**
  - `A cinematic video in a 9:16 vertical aspect ratio. The camera performs a slow orbit, starting with a top-down view of a finished ink-and-watercolor illustration of a small stone church on a sheet of paper, resting on a rustic wooden tabletop. Then, in a dynamic, forceful animation, the 2D church illustration, pivoting on its bottom edge, quickly flips up from the paper like a rigid cutout (the paper itself remains flat and stationary). It immediately slams back down onto the surface, and upon impact, it instantly snaps into its final, solid 3D diorama form. As this happens, the camera circles the action, ending on a medium shot. The entire model must strictly retain its ink-and-watercolor aesthetic. The scene is lit by soft, directional window light, and a shallow depth of field with a tilt-shift effect enhances the miniature feel.`
- **Learning:** This success reinforces the preference for prompts that fuse a clear, physical animation process with simultaneous, reactive camera work, all described in a single, concise paragraph.
