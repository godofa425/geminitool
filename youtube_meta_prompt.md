### **[START TEMPLATE]**

**1. Core Video Information:**

*   **Key Visuals:** [List the most important visual elements. e.g., "Watercolor art style, rustic wooden table, paper flipping up, miniature diorama, soft window lighting."]
*   **Key Audio & Sounds:** [List the primary sounds, music, or triggers. e.g., "ASMR paper sounds, soft thud, gentle piano music, no talking."]
*   **Video Length:** [Specify the length, e.g., "19 seconds (YouTube Short)" or "8 minutes."]

**2. Audience & Goal:**
*   **Target Audience:** [Who is this video for? e.g., "ASMR community, art lovers, people looking for relaxing content."]

**3. Generation Rules (for the AI):**
*   **Strict Adherence:** Generate content **only** from the information provided in 'Core Video Information'. Do not add any details, concepts, or sounds that are not explicitly listed.
*   **No Assumptions:** Do not make up things. If critical information (like the main subject) is missing, state what is needed instead of proceeding.
*   **YouTube Shorts Priority:** If the video is a YouTube Short, all outputs must be optimized for that format (concise, direct, and mobile-friendly).

**4. AI Generation Task:**

Based on the information provided above, please generate the following assets for my YouTube video:

**I. YouTube Titles:**
*   Generate **5-7 title options** in English.
*   Create a variety of styles:
    *   **Direct & Keyword-Focused:** Clearly state what the video is (e.g., "ASMR Paper Sounds Animation").
    *   **Intriguing & Mysterious:** Create curiosity (e.g., "I drew something, and then this happened...").
    *   **Benefit-Oriented:** Focus on the viewer's experience (e.g., "The Most Relaxing Animation You'll See Today").
*   **For YouTube Shorts:** All titles must be short, punchy, and attention-grabbing.

**II. YouTube Description:**
*   Write a YouTube video description that is optimized for search (SEO).
*   **Crucially, place the most important keywords within the first 1-2 sentences.**
*   Give a brief, engaging overview of the video's content based *only* on the provided details.
*   If applicable (e.g., for ASMR), create a bulleted list of specific "Triggers" or key moments mentioned in the audio section.
*   **For YouTube Shorts:** The description must be very brief (1-3 sentences maximum).

**III. YouTube Hashtags:**
*   Provide a list of **10-15 relevant hashtags**.
*   Include a mix of broad, popular hashtags (e.g., #ASMR, #Animation) and more specific, niche ones (e.g., #Papercraft, #ArtASMR).
*   **For YouTube Shorts:** Always include `#Shorts` as one of the first hashtags.
