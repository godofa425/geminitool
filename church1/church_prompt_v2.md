### Final English Prompt (for Veo 3)
*This is the complete, concise prompt ready to be used.*

A cinematic video in a 9:16 vertical aspect ratio. The camera performs a slow orbit, starting with a top-down view of a finished ink-and-watercolor illustration of a small stone church on a sheet of paper, resting on a rustic wooden tabletop. Then, in a dynamic, forceful animation, the 2D church illustration, pivoting on its bottom edge, quickly flips up from the paper like a rigid cutout (the paper itself remains flat and stationary). It immediately slams back down onto the surface, and upon impact, it instantly snaps into its final, solid 3D diorama form. As this happens, the camera circles the action, ending on a medium shot. The entire model must strictly retain its ink-and-watercolor aesthetic. The scene is lit by soft, directional window light, and a shallow depth of field with a tilt-shift effect enhances the miniature feel.

Once built, the church's small wooden doors open and a tiny, stylized person walks out.

Sounds: A sharp whoosh as it flips up and a solid 'thud' as it lands, followed by a gentle acoustic piano score. A faint door creak, and a single distant church bell at the end.

### 中文释义 (Chinese Translation)
*This is the full Chinese translation of the concise prompt above.*

一段电影感的竖屏视频，宽高比9:16。摄像机进行缓慢的轨道运动，始于俯视视角，画面为一张质朴木桌上的一张纸，纸上是一幅完成的石头小教堂的水彩插画。随后，在一个充满动态和力量感的动画中，2D的教堂插画以其底部边缘为轴心，如同一块硬纸板般快速地从纸上翻起（纸张本身保持平坦静止）。它立即猛地拍回纸面，在撞击纸面的瞬间，“啪”地一下定格为最终的、坚实的3D立体模型。在此过程中，摄像机围绕着这个动作旋转，最终停在中景镜头上。整个模型必须严格保持其钢笔和水彩画的美学风格。场景被柔和的定向窗光照亮，浅景深和移轴效果增强了微缩感。

建造完成后，教堂的小木门打开，一个风格化的微型小人走了出来。

音效：在翻起时有一个短促有力的“嗖”声，并在其落地时伴有一声坚实的“砰”声，随后是轻柔的原声钢琴配乐。微弱的开门声，以及结尾处一声遥远的教堂钟声。
